    <p>Data centers, which are integral to the functioning of the computing industry, contribute significantly to carbon emissions.
	These facilities require substantial amounts of energy for operation and cooling. Sustainable practices involve adopting renewable energy sources,
	improving energy efficiency, and employing innovative cooling technologies to reduce the carbon footprint of data centers.</p>
